00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.160
<v ->Your boss tasked you with training a new co-worker,</v>

2
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.360
now what?

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.540
The skills that make you a top performer

4
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.240
don't automatically make you the best teacher.

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.320
So, how can you create a smooth experience

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.470
and get your co-worker up to speed quickly?

7
00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:23.470
Effective training begins with preparation.

8
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.600
Having the necessary space, software and processes prepared

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.310
equips your new co-worker with the resources they need

10
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.440
to learn and excel.

11
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.180
It also helps you stay organized

12
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.430
and on top of training goals.

13
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.710
First, secure the space and tools your co-worker needs

14
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.440
to do their job.

15
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.830
This includes software or other accounts,

16
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.560
workspace and work equipment.

17
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.130
Next, develop a training plan.

18
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.310
What's your end goal, and how will you get there?

19
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.380
Identify learning outcomes first,

20
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.720
and then backtrack

21
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.230
to map out the milestones and steps to reach them.

22
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.270
Finally, document all work processes, procedures

23
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.283
or other information you plan to cover during training.

24
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.100
Your co-worker will likely feel overloaded at first

25
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.050
by new information.

26
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.010
Not all of it will stick.

27
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.580
Digitally documenting work processes and training

28
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.280
gives co-workers a resource

29
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.303
they can refer back to as needed.

30
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.650
If this is your first time training someone,

31
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.240
you might feel insecure about your mentoring skills.

32
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.800
Remind yourself that you don't have to be a manager

33
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.590
to have valuable knowledge and experience to share.

34
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950
The best trainers have empathy.

35
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.920
Try putting yourself in a trainee's shoes.

36
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.580
What do you wish someone had told you

37
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.570
when you first started?

38
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.010
What resources would you have found helpful

39
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.053
during your first weeks on the job?

40
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.220
You can also create a better learning experience

41
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.170
by following these six training tips.

42
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.500
First, personalize training

43
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.890
by getting to know your co-worker.

44
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.270
Establishing good rapport

45
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.060
and introducing your co-worker to other team members

46
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.313
is equally important for their acclimation and success.

47
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.650
If you're training a co-worker in person,

48
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.490
consider having them shadow you for the first day

49
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.360
or week on the job.

50
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.620
Or, if you're training remotely,

51
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.280
share your screen over video calls.

52
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.303
Give examples to show what you mean.

53
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.750
Practice makes perfect

54
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.890
and learning by doing

55
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.170
is one of the most effective ways for trainees

56
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.950
to boost retention or identify knowledge gaps.

57
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.720
Make sure to review their work and give regular feedback.

58
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.980
At the same time,

59
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.940
don't overwhelm new co-workers with too much, too fast.

60
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.440
Instead, control the flow of information

61
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.773
by breaking training into small, incremental steps.

62
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.970
This point can be tricky to navigate.

63
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.680
While you don't want to throw a new hire

64
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.300
in the deep end right away,

65
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.400
you should also avoid doing everything for them.

66
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.530
Strike the right balance by establishing stepping stones

67
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.113
and increase your co-workers responsibilities over time.

68
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.140
For our next tip,

69
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.540
remember that you're not only training a co-worker

70
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.110
on how to do a job,

71
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.140
you're also teaching them how to excel

72
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.460
within your company culture.

73
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.150
Look for opportunities to highlight your team values

74
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.310
in everyday actions and decisions.

75
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.130
Finally, ask your co-worker how things are going

76
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.870
on a regular basis.

77
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.780
Do they have any questions?

78
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.800
Have they come across issues or problems?

79
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.100
Some employees may feel too intimidated or embarrassed

80
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.000
to bring up a question unless you approach them.

81
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.760
Or, they may not even think about questions

82
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.150
until you carve out the time and space

83
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.050
Training others demands different skills

84
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.200
than doing the job yourself.

85
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.640
There will likely to be a learning curve

86
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.030
for both trainer and trainee.

87
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.660
However, with preparation, patience

88
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.270
and a good training plan,

89
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.253
you can successfully get a new co-worker up to speed.
